For the <i>Reinforcement Learning</i> course at Edinburgh, I applied different RL techniques to a robot football scenario, specifically the [half field offense (HFO)](https://github.com/raharrasy/HFO) problem. Some of the algorithms that were covered included:

- SARSA, Q-Learning (Single-agent, discrete state space)
- Deep RL with [Asynchronous Q-Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.01783.pdf) (Single-agent, continuous state space)
- Independent Q-Learning, Joint Action Learning, [WoLF-PHC](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mmv/papers/01ijcai-mike.pdf) (Multi-agent, discrete state space)

It was a really rewarding (ha!) course, and I hope to be able to revisit RL in some NLP setting at some point. Happy to share code upon request.
