I am currently a PhD student at [MIT](https://www.mit.edu/) supervised by [Yoon Kim](https://people.csail.mit.edu/yoonkim/).
Previously, I interned at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/) in [Siva Reddy](https://sivareddy.in/)'s lab.
Before then, I completed an MPhil in Advanced Computer Science at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/), where I was supervised by [Ryan Cotterell](https://rycolab.github.io/).
I did my undergrad at the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/), where I was supervised by [Shay Cohen](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/scohen/).

Currently, I am mainly interested in efficient techniques for LLM training and inference, instruction tuning, and improving the trustworthiness of LLM generations.
