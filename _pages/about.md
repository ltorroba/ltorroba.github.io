I am NLP-focused computer science student wrapping up his MPhil in Advanced Computer Science at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/). I was supervised by [Ryan Cotterell](https://rycolab.github.io/), where we developed methods to probe contextual word representations.
Previously, I studied at the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/), where I worked on the historical event ordering task, supervised by [Shay Cohen](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/scohen/).
My current (though volatile) research interests are probing and Bayesian statistics.
