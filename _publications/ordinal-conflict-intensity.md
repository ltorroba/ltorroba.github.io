Measuring the intensity of events is crucial for monitoring and tracking armed conflict. In this paper, we propose a generative model that captures the intensity of conflict-related events via an ordinal latent variable. We evaluate the proposed model both intrinsically and extrinsically, showing that it obtains good held-out predictive performance.
